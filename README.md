# Portfolio Website

## About

This is a portfolio website built with React and JS (Create React App) to showcase some of my projects. When built, it is a  static page with a few sections and links.


## Usage

```
$ git clone https://github.com/robbypark/portfolio.git
$ cd portfolio
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`


## Deployment

```
$ npm run build
```

Then host a static file server pointing to the /build/ directory.


## Dependencies

See `package.json`. `npm install` will download all dependencies. Some of the modules I used to achieve certain effects:

* particles.js - For particle effect on the landing page
* react-scrollable-anchor - Scroll to page sections on button click, used in the nav bar.
